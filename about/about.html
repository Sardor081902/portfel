            <p>My name is Sardor. I am 17 years old and I live in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan>&#128269Uzbekistan.</a> I am a student in the 11th grade. I study hard because I want to enter a good university in the future.  My favorite subjects are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">&#128269English</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language">&#128269Information Technology</a>.

In my free time, I like listening to music, watching movies, and doing sports. I also enjoy learning new things, especially about computers and programming. I think technology is very important in our modern world.

I am a friendly and positive person. I like helping others and spending time with my friends. My dream is to become a web developer and work on interesting projects that help people.

I believe that if I study well and work hard, I can achieve all my goals.</p>
