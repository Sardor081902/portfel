        <h2>About Me</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I’m a driven and curious aspiring IT specialist currently finishing secondary school and preparing to study computer science at university. I love solving problems, building things that work, and learning new technologies fast. Over the last few years I’ve focused on web development fundamentals and programming basics — experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make interactive pages, and using Python for small scripts, data tasks, and algorithm practice. My approach is practical: I learn by building — personal projects, small automation scripts, and school assignments are my classroom.

Technically, I’m comfortable with front-end development (HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript) and I’m expanding into backend and general-purpose programming with Python. I use Git for version control and I’m learning to structure projects, debug effectively, and write clean, maintainable code. I’m familiar with core programming concepts — functions, data structures, control flow — and I’m actively improving my understanding of algorithms and computational thinking so I can solve more complex problems and succeed in competitive programming and university admission tests.

On the projects side, I build and iterate quickly: personal portfolio pages, responsive layouts, simple web apps (forms, interactive UI components), and small automation scripts in Python. These projects taught me to turn an idea into a working prototype, to test and refine user interfaces, and to troubleshoot real bugs under pressure. I enjoy the whole development lifecycle — from planning and wireframing to coding, testing, and deployment — and I’m excited to scale up to larger, collaborative projects.

Beyond code, I bring persistence, curiosity, and a hacker’s mindset. I love reading documentation, following tutorials to learn new stacks, and breaking problems into smaller steps until they become solvable. I’m used to self-study and rapid iteration: if an approach fails, I try another and keep the parts that work. I value clear communication and teamwork — I seek feedback, document my work, and try to make my code understandable to others.

My short-term goal is to enter a university IT program (I’m preparing for applications and exams) and to gain practical experience through internships and open-source contributions. Long-term, I want to become a versatile software engineer who can design reliable systems, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep learning throughout my career. I’m especially interested in web technologies, systems programming, and applied problem solving.

If you’re looking for a motivated junior developer or a team member who learns quickly and ships working code, I’d be glad to connect. My portfolio contains live examples of my work, source code for small projects, and notes about what I’m learning next — check it out to see how I think and build.
